                        hey! I'm Bob, if you haven't already gathered that by now. I'm a painter turned software engineer from Daytona, Florida. I specialize in the backend, primarily Node and Rust, but love building with whatever tools are right for the job.
                        I currently work for Google on Google Photos. I also toss in my ¬¢2 with the design systems teams from time to time (once an artist, always an artist, amirite?).
                        Outside of work, I still love to paint. Any given Sunday you'll find me scribbling some happy clouds with my son ‚òÅÔ∏è I even teach courses online if you're looking to learn!
                        I'm passively looking for new positions where I can merge my love for code with my love for the canvas. If you think you've got an opening that I might like, let's connect üîó
